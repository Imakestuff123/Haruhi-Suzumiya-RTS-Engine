# HaruhiRtsMaybe

This is a little game that I made for fun. It is currently not closed to finished, and production has ceased for the time being, but I may finish it later. This game was inspired by a game called day of sagittarius iii, which was a game that appeared in the anime the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I thought it looked cool in the anime, so I wanted to make it in real life. It differs from the anime version in many aspects though. It was meant to be a space rts that was playable on lan. Each person was part of a team and given a specific amount of ships. They can control these ships and send them to specific areas to attack enemy ships, as well as gather sight, as the whole map is covered in fog of war. Furthermore, you can divide your number of ships into several fleets, giving you more sight throughout the map, but making them harder to manage and control overall. I made this game in raw java.
